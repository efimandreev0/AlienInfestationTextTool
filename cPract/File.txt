Okay, I get it... What are you doing here?
Do you want to come with us? We could use the help...
What should I call you, Private?
Uh... I better not... There could still be survivors out there... I need to stick around and help out my guys...
Any luck?
That's right! I'm equally surprised to see you in one piece!
Ok... let me know if you change your mind.
I do. Semper Fi, Marine. Good Luck!
Well, they weren't my best ribs, but they weren't bad... A little salty, I guess...
Well, come with us... We can look together.
Hey Marine... You alone out here?
I have not. There was no purpose to do so.
Give them Hell, Leathernecks! Don't let them get away with this!
I didn't mean...
Marine, are you okay?
Sir... I have to insist that you come with us... It's really not safe, Sir.
Yes, most definitely. I am PFC James Kim Jr. USCM. I can do anything! You name it...
loaded, the portrait
Lance Corporal Hank Thompson.
Corporal! You're still alive!
Sir! You haven't budged...
I'll be alright... Go on... Maybe we'll run into each other again.
Negative... All MIA at this point... I hate to even think about what's happening to those poor bastards...
I'm mostly tryin' not to get eaten... mostly.
Yeah?
Okay Marine... I understand.
Yes
I got separated from my Fire Team when those 800-pound grasshoppers showed up.
I understand. Good Luck, Marine.
Not yet... I gotta be sure... I'm sorry, but I gotta be sure!
Private First Class Angel Sinise. But you can call me Cuchillos.
What do you think I want, you ornery, old coot? I want your help!
...
Sergeant, you're still here!
Lance Corporal! Wait up!
Well, good luck, Lance Corporal.
Call me "Bonesaw"...
No thanks, Marine. I'll take my chances holding down the fort.
Yes, but I haven't located any of my Team yet! I can't waste any more time talking to you. Please, leave me alone!
What happened to your previous squad?
What are you doing holed up here, Corporal?
Does that mean you still won't come with us?
That is correct.
Hey! Just because I ain't betting on you doesn't mean I'm not rooting for you... Whatever it is your doing, keep it up!
No... I've been able to keep alive so far... I've gathered up a lot of supplies... Help yourself to anything you need...
I am... what are you doing here?
I'm concerned that it might be my fault... I warned them... I'm a jinx!
Great, Marine. Welcome to Fire Team Fox. What's your handle?
Continue
No, why?
Are you sure, Sergeant?
We could use more of that kinda thinking right now... Care to reconsider joining us?
No
OoRah!
Well, it does smell good! Why don't you grab your ribs and come with us. We could use an extra hand.
Yeah? Well, when you put it that way... Ok... I'll join you guys... Just one condition.
Let's GTFO!
Um... Ok... Let's go.
Well, we could use you in Fox Team... Can you help us?
This area isn't very defendable... Why don't you fold into our Team? We could really use you!
Yes. You may take any supplies you need from my inventory before you proceed on without me.
Yeah? I guess I'm not crazy after all... Bummer... I was kinda hoping I was...
Are you sure? You can hook up with us...
Lance Corporal John Losso, Fire Team Echo,  Charlie Squad, 1st Platoon, Bravo Company, 2nd Battalion, 9th Regiment, 2nd Division, United States Colonial Marines. Serial number 68915280...
Huh?
Think about it, Sergeant. Good luck.
Sure thing... I'm Corporal Frank Heston. They call me "Bonesaw."
No... I need to find my teammates now... Jill says it's not cool to leave them behind.
Okay Sergeant... We are leaving. Do you want to come with us? We could use you...
Marine! Identify yourself!
You mean aside from waking up in Hell's Ant Farm? Yeah, I'm fine...
Private! I can't believe you're still alive!
Quit
Look! The Jinx is still alive!
Sergeant Jay Henick. I reckon I will join up with you all... I'm lookin' for a little payback, if you know what I mean.
Found some more ammo and med kits... But that's about it... I can't quit looking though... They could still be out there somewhere!
You got a call sign, Private?
Look! It's the rib guy!
Private, any luck locating survivors?
Affirmative... I'm just looking for my Fire Team.
That fits...
Good! Now, let's go settle up!
Are you sure you want me to?
Grillin' and chillin'...
You'll be safer with us...
Marine!
Negative. I believe they may all be KIA.
Excellent. What's your name, Marine?
I guess not... What's your name, Marine?
Well, we could use an extra hand, Cuchillos... You want to join us?
What happened to your Fire Team?
Sigh... fine, I'm bored here anyway. PFC Zoe Kennedy, reporting for death duty.
I can't... Not as long as my buddies are out there... Maybe I can catch up with you later...
Don't worry, Private... We'll find them. Why don't you fall in with us?
No offense, but I've never been much of a pack hunter... I need to do this alone. You can take your pick from whatever supplies I got going on, but then you should be on your way... Let me do what I have to do.
Read my psych eval. I'm full of smiles.
Very well, Marine. I will join your ranks.
Searching for my Fire Team.
I can make it one.
Any luck?
Sir! You don't look like you've moved an inch!
Whoa! You shouldn't be sneaking up on a guy like that... Not after the craziness I've just been through...
Private! You okay?
What's it look like? I'm making my last stand! Those bugs aren't getting me without a fight!
Agreed. Can I join your Fire Team for some Xenomorph ass kicking?
Forget it. Look, you can take some of these supplies, but I can't go with you... Come back in your most desperate hour, and then maybe I'll go with you!
Is that an order?
Negative. I'm still looking...
Whatever you say, Private... Good luck.
Okay, Marine... We tried... Good luck!
Yeah... well, no problem. Are you ready to come with us?
Lance Corporal, you okay?
Of course... I told you I wasn't going anywhere...
Access Denied
Really? I can hang with that! You won't regret this!
You think I don't know that, man? That's why I got to find them. They could be in trouble. Escucha esto... I can give you some ammo and med-kits, so you vatos can move on. I need to stay and find my hermanos.
That's firme, homie. I'm down.
Whisky Tango Foxtrot? I know dude! Just let me do this!
That's a mouthful, Sir. Are you okay?
spreadsheet is
Who the hell else would it be?
Oh good, then you've seen them too...
Are you sure, Lance Corporal? It's dangerous!
Thanks Sergeant. Stay safe.
Hell yeah! That dog'll hunt!
OK, man... Good luck...
Sir, it's dangerous to be alone right now... Maybe you should come with me...
Thanks Private. Do you want to come with us?
Ok, Sergeant... Let's go!
Sounds good. Let's kick some ass!
Heck, I'm fine, pilgrim, thanks for askin'!
They may not come back, Sergeant... Do you want to come with us?
Marine, do you require assistance?
What brings you back to Bug Country?
Dead. Maybe... I dunno for sure...
Stayin' alive... Same as you...
Knife Trick game unlocked. You can access this game from the Extras menu.
Key Card 4 Required
Negative. You can take some of my supplies... Ammo, meds... But I cannot leave my post until I receive new orders from Command. Sorry.
Good thing...
Dave "BBQ" Williams.
Hold your fire! I'm a human!
That's the plan.
Alright... Lotsa luck, buddy...
The creatures... I know... we've seen them too...
That's right... You were expecting to find a corpse?
Marine! You're still here?
Thanks Marine... I appreciate the offer, but I can't give up on my squad... Not unless I get word from the top...
As you wish! Good luck...
That would probably be for the best... Private First Class Deepak Singh, at your command!
Not yet... But I haven't given up...
Let's get moving, Beta... There's much to do!
Yes dammit! We could use your help!
Just fall in, Corporal...
What's your name, Lance?
Why don't you come with us, Coleman? We could use the help...
Sergeant, you're still here.
Hey! Over here!
Private! Are you alright?
Friendlies! Hold your fire!
Just me and the bugs.
That's a pretty bleak outlook.
What's your battle plan? You turning tail or are you in this fight?
Private! I can't believe you're still here!
Oorah! Let's move!
Are you ready to join us?
Not sure... I'm not even sure what happened! Somebody screamed and everyone started shooting! I took up a fighting position and waited for a target... Never got one... I started looking for the guys and got hungry... Can't fight on an empty stomach!
Well, this neighborhood has gone to pot... I'm surprised anyone is still alive here!
PFC Fischer.
It's not me I'm worried about...
You're impossible! See you around, Marine...
Welcome aboard, Corporal Heston.
TTYL!
Hell yeah I'll roll with you, homie! Let's kick some alien culo!
Well, why don't you fall in with us, Marine... This place is dangerous.
No. I remain as we last met.
temp1 from generaldialogdump
No man, I'm still looking.
I was pretty pissed earlier... I've had some time to calm down... Now I just want to find my Fire Team and bail.
Okay... Good luck!
Marine...
So are you ready to come along?
Copy that, Cuchillos. Let's move!
Private, you're still here.
Do you want to come with us? It would be safer than hanging out here alone...
I think so, ey. I'm alive at least. Given the situation, I can't complain about that, man.
Whoa! What are you doing here, Sir?
What's your name, Marine?
Don't worry, buddy... I can tell the difference between a Marine and an eight foot Prayin' Mantis.
Sure... I guess that's the best thing I could do right now... My name is Hank Thompson. My Team called me "Husker" on the account that I hail from Nebraska...
Maybe you should come with us, Private...
Yeah... It's just... I haven't found all of my Fire Team... I found some pieces of them, but...
Look... We need your help... Are you in?
Have this Marine join your squad?
Don't press your luck, Jarhead... And my name's Amber, by the way... PFC Amber Fischer.
Private! You're still alive!
LOLZ!
My name is PFC Jimmy Kim. You won't regret this...
What's up, ese?
Then you can count Corporal Frank Heston in.
Okay Private, pull it together... I need you to help us make this right... Can you do that?
Am I supposed to be impressed?
What's that?
Heh, I guess so...
Howdy Pardner!
I'd rather die.
It sounds like combat has changed you...  It changes us all...  What the Hell, I'll join you...  Gung-Ho! Let's stomp these bastards!
Well, if that ain't statin' the obvious...
Okay thanks, Private. Good luck.
Yeah... They all said I was one can short of a six pack...
Nope. I'm not budging! Those creatures are everywhere and I only feel safe with the bulkhead at my aft!
Okay, let's get out of here, Beta.
can be whatever
Yeah, that doesn't sound like too bad of a plan now...  I'd be happy just havin' someone else to talk to again!
But...
Orale, Homes. You got it!
Sorry Devil Dog... After I eat, I'm going back out to find my boys... You can help yourself to some of my supplies though, if that will help. You understand, right?
Hello Marine.
Of course I'm in...
Please touch a Marine's portrait to continue the fight.
We're down a body. We could use your help...
Fall in Thompson. It's time for a good, old fashioned Bug Hunt!
No dice. My squad got split up... These giant insect-like monsters appeared out of nowhere... They just swarmed us... We pretty much got pwned!
"Five-Pack"?
Yeah... back at ya. Were you able to reach your Fire Team yet?
I think you should come with us...
Yeah... How's that working out for you?
Huh? Who? What the Hell do you want?
Maybe you should come with us... You know, combine our efforts...
Phobos Key Card Required
Fall in, Losso! We got some bugs to hunt!
Ok, "Cowboy"... Let's mosey!
Wha? Oh sorry... I was trying to get a signal on this PDT Locator...
Good luck, private.
The Marine has taken your place.
I assume they're still around here somewhere... Unless they ditched me... Or they're dead. If they did ditch me they'll wish that they were dead... Regardless, I'm hanging out here until I receive new orders.
It's you again... Did you ever find your Fire Team?
Damn! You scared me again! I guess I'm too jumpy...
Just shut your trap before more stupid falls out...
Well, let's go squash these bugs, Husker!
Why are you making ribs, Lance? Where is your Fire Team?
To what?
Hook up?
They're probably KIA, Lance Corporal... Why don't you come with us?
You shouldn't be... I'm badass!
Then I'm in, pard. The name's Sergeant Jay Henick. Let's hit the trail...
Marine, are you okay?
Grilling?
I could do that.
Key Card 3 Required
Look, if I wanted to run off and get myself killed by giant bugs, I'd have done so a while ago. I'm waiting here until I receive new orders. See ya!
I guess not... This is quite a stockpile you have here!
We got split up... Ambushed by... well, you wouldn't believe me if I told you... Hell, I don't believe it and I was there...
Positive. Now get outta here before you lead more of those things here!
Relax pal... If I was gonna shoot you, you'd be dead already...
Private... This is serious!
Sergeant! You're still alive!
No! I'm not about to go running into the mouth of madness with you fools... I'm fine here! Now be off with ya!
Negative... But I made contact with Command. I've been cleared to join up with you.
Against my better judgment... I think I'll join you guys.
I'm not surprised.
Lance Corporal Mike Coleman...
Well, what are we waiting for?
Join our squad, Private. We could use you.
Are you sure, Marine?
Are you sure, Sir?
Right... I just figured... Well...
Say Again?
Excuse me?
What's your name?
Private! We thought you were dead!
Excuse me?
Well, Heck ya I am, pardner! Be harder than gristle to get me to leave!
You see me standing here, donchu, man?
Are you deaf, Marine? I said I'm staying. Now get!
These things tend to leave corpses wherever they go... Glad you're not one of them.
I am fine.
So what happened to your Team?
I don't have time to hear what you're saying! I must find them! If you need my supplies, take them! But then please leave me to my work!
Why don't you come with us now, Corporal? We could really use your shooting skills!
Gone, amigo.
Nothing?
Um... okay... Goodbye, Sir.
I was just kidding. Look, I got separated from my Fire Team... Can I hook up with you?
Marine! Are you okay?
You should really come with us... No sense in searching for them alone.
Watch it boy, I don't take kindly...
Are you sure you want to quit?
Marine! Identify yourself!
You don't seem very concerned...
No... I pray that they escaped as I did, cuz I didn't find a soul.
You're not the only one, pal... This place is crawling with crazy!
We're in the fight! Gung-Ho, Devil Dog. Now you should fall in so we can get going...
So, do you want to come with us yet?
PFC Fischer.
You a big Western fan?
Come with us.
Thought maybe you'd changed your mind... Maybe you'd come with us?
Yes.
Sorry... Can't risk it... Not right now...
I can't argue with that... But I need some time to clear my head... You can take these med kits and ammo though...
Are you sure? It might be safer if we worked together...
To be honest, me either! I'm glad you were able to triangulate my position and find me again!
Those monsters! They got them! You were right!
I'll be sure to do that... See you around.
Gone... Not quite sure what happened to them... I imagine it's not good though...
Hold on... I'm texting my BFF Jill in 3rd Platoon. You just made me type "Are you okay".
Independent
Well, you wanna hedge your bets? Join up with us. We've been doing okay so far.
They're being digested in some bug's stomach. I hope you guys fight better than them.
Let's go, BBQ!
temp2 from generaldialogdump
I think so... But my Team... They're gone!
Do you want to come with us? Maybe we can find them together?
What are you doing here?
Upon reaching Security Bio Scan Chamber (45), player is scanned and accepted.
I was waiting for someone to find me. My name is Marine Gunner Friedric Rook Marcus.
They called me "Cowboy".
I admire your determination, but you should probably come with us, Marine...
No. I am fine here, Marine. I will wait in this location until I receive further instructions.
Save the gory details, Private... I get it.
Sergeant! You're still here!
You can come with us, Marine... We could use you.
Me too, brother... Did you have any luck? Did you find your Fire Team?
Roger that... Good luck.
Sorry man... No can do... But you guys seem to be doing just fine... If you have nothing to lose, look me up...
PFC Angel Sinise. But my homies call me Cuchillos.
I meant with finding your Fire Team. Any luck finding your Team?
We kill 'em all. To our last bullet. Are you okay with that?
Well, we could really use you...
Well, fall in... Um, what's your name?
Yup... I haven't had much luck as of yet...
Marine! What's your status?
Target successfully destroyed. Elevator is now activated.
PFC Kennedy.
Let me get a good look at you... Okay... You look alright...
Still not interested.
Hold your fire, Marine!
Don't shoot, Marine! It's us again!
PFC Mei-Lin Chau... Just call me Beta.
Are you out here alone? Where's your Team?
Not yet... But I'm not about to give up anytime soon...
I'll take the kits.
Semper Fi, brother. Good luck!
I'd be dead? Look kid, I saw more fighting in my first week at Shelton's Pass than you'll see in your entire career...  So you worry about yourself...  This old timer can take care of himself!
Lance Corporal! Did you hear from your Team?
You'll be safe, I promise...
Marine! Are you okay?
I am. Jill said if I get killed that I would miss the new 1337s when they come out next year! Dude, those things are seriously fast... We're talking 300nhz fast!
Hey Marine!
We'll look for them... We just need to stick together...
Making a stand. I lost the rest of my Fire Team... No way I'm letting those bastard monsters take me alive!
Lance Corporal Mike "Five-Pack" Coleman...
That's the spirit. Now come on, let's finish this!
Thanks. Let me know if you change your mind...
Sigh...  Okay, fine. But I'm only doing this because I want to... Not because you told me to!
Corporal Jeff Palms... Just call me "Lucky"...
Gone?
Did you hear from your Fire Team?
Mosey?
I can't! I must find my Fire Team. That's all that matters to me right now!
Annoyed. But what else is new?
I am fine, thank you for asking, Marine.
Are you a doc?
You know, I was short too... 13 days and a wake up... Can you believe that? That's how lucky I am!
We can fold you into our Fire Team, Sergeant. What's your name?
I'm fine... My Team... They're gone... I must find 'em!
Sure. I'll help you guys. This bad boy looks just about done... Lance Corporal Dave "BBQ" Williams at your service!
Red Key Located
Hook up? Sorry, not interested. I've got some extra ammo and med-kits here if you need 'em, though.
Sir! What are you doing out here all alone? Are you okay?
Sergeant Jasper Watson.
Are you sure you don't want to come with us?
Oh that! Unfortunately, no...
You're probably right... Okay, I'll follow you.
Sorry to shatter your world, uh...
Great. Let's move out, Five Pack...
Well, at least your luck hasn't completely run out... Why don't you come with us? We could use a hand...
Rrright... Let's move out, Sir.
Yup... dunno where... Got separated durin' the gunfight. But I've been sendin' out my location to 'em... Hopefully they'll all get the message and regroup here with me.
Um... Yeah. So did you finish up whatever you were doing?
You seem to be taking it well... I mean, all things considered.
Well, good luck Lance Corporal.
What are you doing here? Where's your Fire Team?
Well, it would be easier with some help... Did you have a change of heart about coming with us?
Marine, what are you doing?
Affirmative. I still haven't found my Fire Team.
No! I'll find them! I can't turn my back on my brothers!
You bet! I added my 29 secret herbs and spices to this MRE Rib Rack and now I'm smoking it with a piece of hickory I picked up on Arcturia. It's gonna be great, you should stick around!
I don't have a license, but I've practiced some surgery in my time... Let's go!
What situation? The one where giant bugs attacked my Fire Team and I barely managed to get away? Is that the situation you mean? Because that's the one I'm texting Jill about...
No crap.
Private! Are you okay?
Um... Uh... yeah...
Excuse me...
Sergeant! Are you okay?
I'm PFC Deepak Singh. My teammates called me "Cowboy".
Lower your weapon, Marine! We're friendly!
Holy Hell, you scared the crap outta me, buddy!
Oh hey... Yeah! I was just taken a breather... Working some stuff out in my head...
of what
Lance Corporal John C. Losso!
Nothing, just trying to lighten things up... I'm ready for a vacation...
Thanks. Want to come with us... You know, safety in numbers?
Did you ever track down your Team?
Key Card 6 Required
Lance Corporal! What's that smell? If I didn't know better, I'd swear it was...
Marine! Are you alright?
Well, you can still come along with us, Private...
Have you been able to reach your men?
Thanks, but no thanks... Maybe if we meet again I'll be more inclined... I just have to find my buddies first.
Private, I don't think you completely grasp the situation that you have found yourself in...
Yeah, we've seen "them." Where's your team, Lance Corporal?
Go to Data Transmission Control Room (15) to download map data
No man, I think they might be muertos, homes.
We're down a man. Will you join our squad?
What's the point? We're all gonna die some day anyway.
Are you talking to me?
I bet you could use me. Your type always does. Look, I got med kits and ammo if you need em. Beyond that, all I can offer is my foot up your ass.
Heh heh, you bet. Fall in, Marine.
Name's Jasper Watson... But everyone calls me "Iron Sights"! Now let's get rolling... We probably don't have much time!
Welcome to Fire Team Fox. Now fall in.
Thank God for that... What are you doing here, Marine?
Marine! What are you doing here?
That's... um... good, right?
Um... No. Not until I finish this text... And I wouldn't wait... It's going to take awhile...
Good point. You should talk to my shrink...
Let's concentrate on wiping these SOBs out instead!
Oorah! What's your name, Sergeant?
The Marine has joined your squad.
What, no flowers?
Hey! It's you boys!
You too, Dogs.
I don't think so... I need more time to figure everything out...
Sure... Just let me catch my breath... Okay, let's go...
I don't think you can be "too jumpy"... Not with those things running around...
Do you want to come with us, Private?
Are you alone? Where's your Fire Team?
Well, the offer still stands, if you want to come with us...
What's your name, Marine?
No... No, I didn't... I just hadn't the heart to give up on 'em... but I reckon it's time I moved on...
Marine! You're still here!
I think I'm better now... I can probably help you guys out.
Key Card 1 Required
Naww... I reckon I'll wait it out a bit... I owe it to my team, ya know? I do have the three B's here if you need 'em: Bullets, Beans, and Bandages... You all help yourself now, ya hear?
Any luck finding your Fire Team, Lance?
Ribs? Well, you'd be right on the mark. Can you pass me that bug juice jar...
Nah... I like doing stuff like this alone... It's easier for me... You go on... I'll BRT.
Did you ever make contact with your Fire Team?
Thank you, Gunner...
Where's your Fire Team, Marine?
you specify
I doubt that... Why don't you come with us?
Fine. Just to shut you up, though.
You're lucky... I almost turned you into Swiss cheese!
Yeah... I'm not dead yet... but not for their lack of tryin' though... Those things are relentless!
Oorah!
Key Card 2 Required
You remembered.
Any luck...?
OMG! Me neither... LOLZ!
Friedric Rook Marcus.
I just can't believe this is happening... It doesn't seem real... Well, I guess I'll get back to my search...
What are you doing here, Marine?
Marine... Marine! Are you alright?
Totally. Grab some ammo and med kits and split... Now, please... You're making my WPM drop to like 80...
I know whatcha mean... But I'm not going for it... I've been doing pretty good without any help and I intend to keep it that way... You can help yourself to my ammo and medical supplies, but I'm staying here... At least for now...
Negative... I've looked all over. I hope they made it, but it don't look good...
Marine, what are you doing?
Well... Um... We should get going... Do you want to come along?
To anything...
You sound as surprised as my nurse back at Linna 349!
It'll take more than king-sized cockroaches to run me off!
Oh hey. I'm Amber, I mean, PFC Fischer...
Just fall in, Fischer.
I'm gonna stay put, but I'm much obliged by yer offer.
What's your name, Marine?
Who are you?
Now saving...
Holdin' position... but I don't think my Team's comin' back now...
Well, you tried at least... Why don't you come with us now?
I need an answer. Will you join our squad?
I hope so, too.
No, I get it. Big tough Marine swoops in to save helpless little PFC Kennedy. Well I ain't no damsel, and I can deal with my own distress.
Heh heh... Yup!
Yup. Good to see you guys are still alive.
LV Key Card Required
Destroy the target with explosives first to activate this elevator.
Well, look who it is... Fire Team Fox. If I were a betting man, which I am, I'd figure you guys for goners by now... Good thing I didn't lay any green on it!
I dunno, man... I'm looking for them, though. Hopefully I find them soon.
PFC Kennedy.
Hey Chef! You're still alive!
Hey Lucky Charms!
Come with us, Private... It's safer than running around this place on your own!
C'mon! That's suicide. Come with us. We could use you...
Really? I think that's what my Squad Leader told me too... Right before an Alien ate his friggin' face off... No offense, man, but I'll wait here... Thanks!
Have this Marine go in your place?
Yeah, I grabbed what I could... Help yourself to any ammo or medicals you need.
My name is Mei-Lin Chau, but everyone calls me Beta.
Key Card 5 Required
Okay, I'll come along... But Corporal Jeff "Lucky" Palms cannot be held personally responsible for any mysterious accidents or inexplicable tragedies that might befall the Fire Team as a result of prolonged exposure to myself. Take me at your own risk!
I'm not saying to do that, all I'm saying is...
Greetings Earthling.
I hear that!
